# Find the Difference

---
### Instructions

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

---

###Example:

```py
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

---

### Solution

```py
def findTheDifference4(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    ordered_s = sorted(s)
    ordered_t = sorted(t)
    return next((b for a, b in itertools.zip_longest(ordered_s, ordered_t) if a != b))
```

* Time Complexity: 0(nlogn)
* Space Complexity: O(n)
